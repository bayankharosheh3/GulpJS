## Description:
In this task, I create a responsive website. I designed and implemented four HTML pages with responsive styling using Bootstrap, ensuring optimal display on various devices. With the help of JavaScript, I achieved seamless page transitions, allowing users to navigate between pages without any interruptions. Furthermore, I implemented dynamic loading of HTML, CSS, and JS files based on the URL, resulting in improved performance by loading only the required resources. Leveraging Gulp.js, I automated the minification of HTML, CSS, and JS files, optimizing their sizes and enhancing the website's performance.


## Deployment:
I encountered a problem during the deployment of the project, but I am going to fix it as soon as possible.In the meantime, you can review the code provided above to get an understanding of the work accomplished.
